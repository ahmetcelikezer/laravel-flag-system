# Laravel Flag System

This package is in development stage, i will create manual right after my first release. The main idea is you can assign flags (flags are like hashtags) to any data in your any database table and you can manage, check these flags.

I was done this at 2017's but the library was not completely OOP and also not composer or laravel supported. I decided the re-create this library for me and the open-source environment.
